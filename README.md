# Sonoff SNZB-02P Driver for Hubitat

## Overview
This custom driver is designed for the **Sonoff SNZB-02P** Zigbee temperature and humidity sensor, allowing seamless integration with the Hubitat Elevation platform. With this driver, you can unlock advanced capabilities, configure reporting intervals, and monitor device presence in real time.

---

## Features
- **Temperature and Humidity Reporting**:
  - Accurate and configurable measurement reporting for both temperature and humidity.
  - Define minimum and maximum reporting intervals and change thresholds.

- **Battery Level Monitoring**:
  - Displays the battery percentage of your Sonoff SNZB-02P sensor.
  - Configurable reporting intervals to optimize performance and battery life.

- **Presence Detection**:
  - Monitors the sensor's activity and triggers a **presence** state.
  - Marks the sensor as "not present" after consecutive failed recovery attempts.

- **Configurable Recovery Mechanism**:
  - Automatically attempts to recover the sensor if it fails to report data.
  - Define how many recovery attempts are allowed before marking the device as "not present."

- **Flexible Configuration**:
  - Customizable preferences for:
    - Temperature reporting intervals and change thresholds.
    - Humidity reporting intervals and change thresholds.
    - Battery reporting intervals and thresholds.
    - Recovery interval (time between recovery checks).
    - Presence trigger (number of failed recovery attempts).

- **Comprehensive Logging**:
  - Debug logging to monitor the driver's activity and interactions with the sensor.
